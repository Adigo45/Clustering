# Mall Customer Segmentation with DBSCAN Clustering
This project focuses on segmenting customers in a mall dataset using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method.

## Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses aiming to understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies to specific segments. In this project, we employed DBSCAN clustering to group customers based on their spatial density, allowing us to uncover distinct customer segments within the dataset.
